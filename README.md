<!-- ## Difficulties/Unsolved Problems
- the orignal recipe API the app utilized was shut down in November 2019 and had to be replaced by the Edamam API.
- The heroku version of the app is not as functional as the local version as Edamam's API only works localy.
- The homepage search button is not redirecting to login as it originally did.
- Users are able to add multiples of the same ingredient when they shouldn't be allowed to. -->

## Future Development
- Using React Router to have components show up as different pages
- Formatting blog posts with paragraphs
- Allowing blog posts to have more than 1 image
